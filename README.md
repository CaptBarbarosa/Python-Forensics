## About This Repository

This space is dedicated to the exploration of digital forensics using Python. As I embark on this learning journey, you'll find exercises sourced from the aforementioned books. The ultimate goal is to cultivate a solid foundation and, eventually, craft personalized tools.


## Learning Journey

While I possess some proficiency in Python, having developed a GUI application that communicates with a server and responds, along with a basic Django website during my university studies, I've come to realize that my learning excels in real-world applications. Hence, instead of opting for "Learn Python in 30 Seconds" kind of books, I've chosen to delve into practical exercises focusing on my interest in cybersecurity.
